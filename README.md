# Capstone-project-2--Yes-Bank-Closing-Price-Prediction
This project was done in order to gain insight from the data of share prices of Yes bank and to predict the stock prices using different Machine Learning Models. The aim is to anticipate the share's closing price for the month given the stock market price data for Yes bank. This information includes the date, lowest, highest, and closing price information.

In order to extract the correct data from the dataset, it is first cleaned and the necessary alterations were made. 

The strategy is fitting a machine learning model to this historical data and attempting to forecast the closing price using the parameters discovered during training. By doing this, we can train our model to recognise trends in the data and then use that knowledge to make predictions. Various regression models, including: linear regression, lasso regression, Ridge regression and Xgboost regression have been used.

The findings are:

The trend of Yes Bank's stock's Close, Open, High, and Low prices has increased up until 2018 and then rapidly decreased. The closing price of shares directly correlates with high, low, and open prices. The data contained a lot of multicollinearity. We achieved 99.6% accuracy with the Linear regression model, and results with the linear regression, Ridge regression and lasso regression were essentially identical. Using the information on the share closing price of Yes Bank, Linear regression is the most effective model to use for the prediction of Yes Bank Stocks.
